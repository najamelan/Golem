# This is the default configuration file for Golem.

# DO NOT CHANGE THIS FILE
# This file is  part of the software, if you change it, consider yourself a Golem developper, not a user.

# Users: make a copy of it and keep just the values you want to change from the defaults, and then pass the
# filename of your own configuration file to the constructor of Golem. Your values will override the values
# in this file.

Golem:

   # The encoding of this and other configuration files. You probably want to leave this on utf-8
   # and make sure it's actually utf-8. If really there is a reason utf-8 would not be a good idea,
   # file an issue on github so we can all learn something, otherwise stick with it!
   #
   # Golem assumes all files on the server, that means php files and Golem configuration files are in this
   # encoding. It has the following consequences:
   # - all values string values read from configuration files will be interpreted as being encoded with this encoding
   # - all literal strings in the php files of Golem will be considered to be in this encoding
   # - the Golem\Text class method __toString() will return strings in this encoding
   #
   configEncoding: 'UTF-8'


Text:

   # The default encoding for strings throughout Golem. You can instantiate Golem\Data\Text objects
   # with other encodings, or convert existing strings, but whenever you don't specify, golem will assume it's
   # this encoding. Recommended: utf-8.
   #
   encoding  : &globalEncoding 'UTF-8'

   # When invalid encoding is detected, which replacement string to use. This should be something understood by
   # mb_substitute_character()
   #
   # Note that when the character doesn't exist in target encoding mbstring will just remove the invalid characters.
   # To prevent this Golem will try to change it. In ascii it will become a question mark '?'.
   # eg. The unicode replacement character doesn't exist in ascii.
