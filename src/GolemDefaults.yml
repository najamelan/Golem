Golem:

   # The encoding of this and other configuration files. You probably want to leave this on utf-8
   # and make sure it's actually utf-8. If really there is a reason utf-8 would not be a good idea,
   # file an issue on github so we can all learn something, otherwise stick with it!
   #
   configEncoding: 'UTF-8'


String:

   # The default encoding for strings throughout Golem. You can instantiate Golem\Reference\Data\String objects
   # with other encodings, or convert existing strings, but whenever you don't specify, golem will assume it's
   # this encoding. Recommended: utf-8.
   #
   encoding  : &globalEncoding 'UTF-8'

   # When invalid encoding is detected, which replacement string to use. This should be something understood by
   # mb_substitute_character()
   #
   substitute: 0xfffd  # �


Logger:

   # Allows to disable logging (not recommended):
   #
   loggingOn:  true

   # Allows to disable exceptions (not recommended):
   #
   throwingOn: true

   # Where to log info/warnings/errors from golem. Values (can be an array of multiple):
   #
   # 'phplog'       : the default php error log
   # '/var/log/...' : a file path where to log
   # 'echo'         : echo errors
   #
   logfile: phplog

   # The default log level, can be 'ALL', 'NOTICE', 'WARNING', 'ERROR', 'OFF'.
   #

   # The default name for a logger
